### Common Questions

**Q: Why does Windows show a security warning?**
A: This happens because the executable isn't digitally signed. It's completely safe - this affects all unsigned software from independent developers.

**Q: Why does the file size appear larger after download?**
A: Windows adds security metadata during download (~111MB becomes ~117MB). This is normal Windows behavior and doesn't affect functionality.

### Usage

- The chatbot will start with a welcome screen and robot ASCII art
- Emojis and Unicode characters are automatically handled for all systems
- Type your messages and press Enter
- The AI will respond with a realistic typing effect
- Simple and intuitive interface
- Automatic fallback to text versions on older systems

## Security & Troubleshooting

### Windows Security Warning

**This is normal behavior** that affects ALL unsigned executables. Here's why:

1. **Unsigned Executable**: No expensive code signing certificate
2. **Unknown Publisher**: Windows hasn't seen this specific file before
3. **Network Activity**: App connects to Together.ai API

**How to run safely:**
1. Click "More info" when you see the warning
2. Click "Run anyway"
3. The app will start normally

**Alternative methods:**
- Right-click ‚Üí Properties ‚Üí Check "Unblock"
- Add to Windows Defender exclusions
- Enterprise: Group Policy whitelist

### File Size Changes

The file may appear larger after download due to Windows security metadata:
- **Original**: ~111MB (actual executable)
- **After download**: ~117MB (includes Windows security data)
- **This is normal** and doesn't affect functionality

### API Key Security

‚ö†Ô∏è **Important Notes:**
- Your API key will be embedded in the executable
- Monitor your Together.ai usage dashboard regularly
- Consider rate limiting on your Together.ai account
- For production use, implement server-side API proxy instead

### For IT Administrators

**Whitelist Information:**
- **Application**: AI_Chatbot.exe
- **Publisher**: Unsigned (individual developer)
- **Network Access**: HTTPS to api.together.xyz only
- **Execution Level**: No elevation required

**Remember**: Security warnings are standard for all unsigned executables. Many legitimate software companies experience the same until they purchase expensive code signing certificates ($300-800/year).
